# Spectra

**Spectra** is a Python-based project designed to read and visualize spectral data from text files. The application processes the spectral data, calculates the resonant wavelength, and displays this information graphically. The main features and future enhancements of this project are outlined below.

## Features

- **Read and Visualize Spectral Data**: The application reads spectral data from text files where each line contains frequency and gain values. These values are then plotted to visualize the spectrum.
  
- **Resonant Wavelength Calculation**: The application calculates the resonant wavelength from the provided spectral data and displays it graphically, allowing for easy analysis of resonance points.

## Planned Enhancements

- **CSV File Support**: Future versions will support reading spectral data from CSV files. This will include both real and synthetic data.
  
- **Lorentz Function Modeling**: The application will be capable of generating synthetic spectral data based on parameters modeling the Lorentz function, providing a complete synthetic spectrum for analysis.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Spectra.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**: 
   Make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can do this with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**: 
   Use the provided Python scripts to start the application and load your spectral data files.

4. **View and Analyze Spectra:**: 
   Load your spectral data files through the application's interface, visualize the spectra, and analyze the calculated resonant wavelengths.
